# iPhoneLiveServer — Build Log

## Session 1: Foundation + Setlist + Queue + Singer Queue — 2026-07-11

`#music #iphoneliveserver #phase-setup`

### Objectives

- Stand up the iPhone webserver as a standalone project in ~/Music/
- Build setlist page with song library search/sort (by genre, artist, key)
- Build queue system: add songs, navigate forward/backward, auto-clear at end
- Build singer queue (karaoke-style) with profanity filtering
- Band view + teleprompter mirror pages
- Password auth + device whitelist
- "Load next song" flow: triggers REAPER load via existing /api/songs/:slug/load endpoint

### Architecture

Single Express server on port 3300 serving all pages:

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/` | Main Show Control — setlist queue, play controls, song search |
| `/band` | Band View — queue/song display, teleprompter mirror |
| `/singer` | Singer Queue — public karaoke signup with profanity filter |
| `/teleprompter` | Teleprompter — lyrics + chord display synced to current song |
| `/api/*` | All data endpoints (songs, queue, auth, config) |

Song library sourced from `~/ReaperSongs/` (existing LiveShowManager format).
Queue state persisted to `data/queue.json`.
Config (password, whitelist, device ID) in `data/config.json`.

### Work Completed

- **Project scaffold**: directory structure, package.json, data directory
- **Server core** (`server/index.js`): Express server, all routes, API endpoints, static file serving, auth middleware
- **Song library** (`server/api/songs.js`): reads ~/ReaperSongs meta.json files, builds searchable/sortable index with genre support
- **Queue engine** (`server/api/queue.js`): main queue + singer queue, forward/backward navigation, load-next trigger, auto-clear at end
- **Auth** (`server/api/auth.js`): password validation, device whitelist with configurable device ID
- **Profanity filter** (`server/api/profanity.js`): 200+ word blocklist for singer names, case-insensitive, substring matching
- **Genre support**: genre-map.json data file (80 songs pre-tagged across classic rock, country, blues, soul, pop, folk, etc.)
- **Main Show Control page** (`public/index.html`): song browser with search/sort, queue display, play controls, load-next button
- **Singer Queue page** (`public/singer.html`): public karaoke sign-up, song browser, name entry with profanity filter (client + server), queue position display, Tip the Band button
- **Band View page** (`public/band.html`): current song display, queue view, teleprompter embed
- **Teleprompter page** (`public/teleprompter.html`): full-screen lyrics/chords display for external monitor
- **Config** (`data/config.json`): password, whitelist, device ID, tip URL
- **Genre map** (`data/genre-map.json`): 80 songs tagged with genres
- **package.json**: dependencies (express, body-parser, cookie-parser)

### Key Design Decisions

- Single server on one port (3300) — no extra processes for different views
- Queue persists to disk — survives server restart
- Load-next triggers REAPER song load via existing LiveShowManager `/api/songs/:slug/load` endpoint
- Password stored in config file, hashed with SHA-256 for transport, plaintext comparison server-side
- Profanity filter uses blocklist approach — more transparent than ML-based and works offline
- Genre map stored separately from meta.json (meta.json is REAPER's source of truth, genres are show-management data)
- Singer queue uses timestamps for ordering (FIFO per round)

### Next Steps / Action Items

- [ ] Add genre tagging UI to main show control page
- [ ] Wire "load song" to actually call the REAPER load endpoint
- [ ] Add MIDI footswitch support (next/prev/play)
- [ ] Add "Placeholder Duo" auto-population from band queue
- [ ] Test QR code generation for singer queue
- [ ] Style pass: make it look good on iPhone 7

## Session 2: TUI + Karaoke Toggle + Search Fixes — 2026-07-11

`#music #iphoneliveserver #tui #karoke`

### Objectives

- Add TUI dashboard (pure Node.js, zero deps) with queue management, search+add, keyboard controls
- Add `start-show` CLI launcher and zsh integration
- Fix Enter-in-search bug (song search was auth-protected, TUI never authenticated)
- Add karaoke ON/OFF toggle: when OFF, `/singer` page shows paused message and blocks signups; songs only addable via TUI/auth pages
- Shift+K to toggle karaoke from TUI
- `karaoke_enabled` and `karaoke_paused_message` stored in `data/config.json` (editable)

### Key Decisions

- TUI uses ANSI escape codes instead of ncurses/libraries — zero deps, same runtime as server
- TUI authenticates via `x-auth-token` header (SHA-256 of config password)
- Song GET endpoints `/api/songs` made public (read-only metadata) so TUI can search without auth
- Karaoke toggle endpoint is auth-free (localhost, non-sensitive)
- Singer page polls karaoke status every 5s alongside queue poll

### Added Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/tui.js` | Full TUI dashboard: Now Playing, Queue (scrollable, cursor), Search+Add overlay, confirm dialogs, event log |
| `scripts/start-show` | Bash launcher: checks server, installs deps, launches TUI |
| `data/genre-map.json` | 80+ songs tagged across 16 genres |

### Modified Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `server/index.js` | Made GET `/api/songs` public (TUI search fix) |
| `server/api/queue.js` | Added `/api/singer/status` and `/api/singer/toggle` endpoints; karaoke check in singer add |
| `server/api/auth.js` | Added `saveConfig()` export; exposed karaoke settings in `/api/config` |
| `server/public/singer.html` | Shows red paused banner + hides signup flow when karaoke OFF |
| `scripts/tui.js` | Karaoke status in stats bar, Shift+K toggle, auth token from config, await doAction on Enter |
| `data/config.json` | Added `karaoke_enabled` and `karaoke_paused_message` |

### Test Results

```
$ curl /api/singer/status                    → {"karaoke_enabled": true, ...}
$ curl -X POST /api/singer/toggle            → {"karaoke_enabled": false}
$ curl -X POST /api/singer/add (while OFF)   → 403 with paused message
$ curl -X POST /api/singer/toggle            → {"karaoke_enabled": true}
$ curl /api/songs/search?q=slow              → Slow Dancing in a Burning Room (2 variants)
$ curl -X POST /api/queue/add (with token)   → {"ok": true, ...}
$ curl -X POST /api/queue/add (no token)     → 401 Unauthorized
```

### Resource Usage (Server)

~63MB RAM idle, ~67MB under load, ~0% CPU, 1s startup, 8MB disk

### Next Steps

- Lighting control page (DMX via MIDI or Art-Net)
- Mixer master page with IEM mix sub-pages
- MIDI footswitch support (next/prev/play)
- Per-song FX recall (amp sims, pedal settings)
- Drag-to-reorder queue on mobile
- Genre tagging UI within show control page
- QR code generation for singer queue access
- GitHub Pages tips page
- "Placeholder Duo" auto-population from band queue
- Singer queue promote to main queue from singer page

## Session 3: Guest Request System + Offline Mode + Show Readiness — 2026-07-11

`#music #iphoneliveserver #karaoke #offline`

### Objectives

- Build public guest request page for GitHub Pages deployment
- Integrate guest submissions with singer queue via external sync
- Add offline-first mode with auto-detection
- Merge parallel OpenCode session work (Cloudflare tunnel redirect, bumper music)
- Make `start show server` launch both servers (3300 + 5800)
- Generate dynamic QR codes with correct network IP

### Architecture

```
Offline (tonight default):
  Guest → WiFi QR → joins "PlaceholderDuo" WiFi → singer QR → http://<IP>:3300/singer
  ↓ instant, no internet
  Singer queue visible in TUI + iPhone controller in real time

Online (auto-detected):
  GitHub Pages guest → jsonblob.com → server syncs every 30s → singer queue
  Server auto-detects internet ~5s after startup
```

### Work Completed

- **Guest request page** (`live-band-karaoke/index.html`): mobile form with name/song/artist, 24-song library hints, admin panel (password: `liveband`), dual-mode submissions (local API or jsonblob fallback)
- **External sync** (`server/api/queue.js`): jsonblob polling with dedup, `/api/singer/external-sync`, `/api/singer/external-add` for direct WiFi submissions, `/api/singer/external-status` and `/api/singer/external-toggle` endpoints, `syncBlobToQueue()` shared function
- **Offline-first mode**: `externalEnabled` defaults to `false`, auto-detects `https://jsonblob.com` reachability after 5s, `startAutoSync()` / `clearInterval` on toggle, `/api/singer/retry-online` for manual retry
- **TUI enhancements**: OFFLINE/ONLINE indicator in title bar, `o` to toggle, `O` to retry detection, `e` to sync now, external pending count in stats bar, guest URL displayed at bottom
- **QR generation** (`scripts/generate-qr`): auto-detects MacBook IP (prefers Ethernet, skips Tailscale), generates WiFi join QR + singer page QR with current IP, updates GitHub Pages tunnel-url.txt, called by `start-show` on startup
- **`start-show` updates**: launches both iPhoneLiveServer (:3300) and Stage HUD (:5800), passes `SHOW_IP` env var to TUI, generates QRs before launch
- **iPhone controller** (`controller.js`): Requests page polls `window.location.hostname:3300` (works from iPhone), badge shows pending count, auto-refresh every 10s
- **Merged work**: Cloudflare tunnel redirect page (`gh-pages/guest.html`), bumper music engine (20 instrumental tracks, `afplay` + WebSocket control)
- **Config**: `karaoke_enabled` default `true`, `externalEnabled` default `false` (offline-first)

### Key Design Decisions

- Offline by default — no internet requests until connectivity confirmed. Show must run without internet.
- Singer page at `/singer` is the primary local guest interface (3-step flow: name → song → confirm)
- GitHub Pages URL is fallback for remote guests; submissions go to jsonblob, synced when online
- QR codes use MacBook's actual IP (not `rig.local`) for reliability across devices
- External sync marks jsonblob entries as `done: true` after importing to prevent duplicates
- Singer queue `external: true` tag distinguishes WiFi guests from remote submissions

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `server/api/queue.js` | Added 30s auto-sync, external-sync/add/toggle/status endpoints, `syncBlobToQueue()`, offline-first default, `retry-online` endpoint |
| `scripts/tui.js` | OFFLINE/ONLINE in title bar, external pending count, `o`/`O`/`e` key bindings, guest URL display, retry-online action |
| `scripts/start-show` | Launches Stage HUD server (:5800), calls `generate-qr`, passes `SHOW_IP` to TUI |
| `scripts/generate-qr` | **NEW** — IP detection, QR generation, GitHub Pages deploy |
| `server/public/singer.html` | Existing singer page verified working (no changes needed) |
| `data/config.json` | `karaoke_enabled: true` (was false) |
| `data/queue.json` | Cleaned/reset for show |
| `live-band-karaoke/index.html` | **NEW** — Guest request page (deployed to GitHub Pages) |
| `live-stage-hud/web/public/controller.js` | Added Requests page, dynamic IP for API calls |
| `live-stage-hud/web/public/request.html` | Local copy of guest page |
| `live-stage-hud/web/server.js` | Added `/request` route |
| `live-stage-hud/web/public/controller.css` | Request badge + page styles |

### Test Results

```
$ curl /api/health                                    → {"status":"ok"}
$ curl /api/singer/external-status                     → sync=False, online=False (offline default)
$ curl -X POST /api/singer/external-add               → Singer added to queue instantly
$ curl /api/singer/queue                               → Singer visible in queue
$ curl /api/singer/external-sync                       → Pulls from jsonblob, marks done
$ curl /api/singer/toggle                              → sync_enabled toggle
$ curl /api/singer/retry-online                        → Re-checks connectivity
$ start show server                                    → Both servers launch, QRs generated, TUI ready
```

### Next Steps

- [ ] Test with actual iPhone 7 on AirPort WiFi
- [ ] Print QR codes
- [ ] Genre tagging UI within show control page
- [ ] Mixer master page with IEM mix sub-pages
- [ ] Drag-to-reorder queue on mobile
- [ ] Lighting control page (DMX via MIDI)
- [ ] MIDI footswitch support (next/prev/play)

## Session 4: Permanent QR + mDNS + Inseego Setup — 2026-07-11

`#music #iphoneliveserver #qr #dns`

### Problem
Printed QR codes hardcoded with an IP would break every time the MacBook got a different DHCP lease. The singer page URL must survive IP changes, router swaps, and reboots.

### Solution
**Primary QR uses `rig.local`** — macOS Bonjour/mDNS auto-advertises the hostname `rig` on any network. No static IP or DHCP reservation needed. All devices on the same WiFi can resolve `.local` names.

**IP-based fallback QR** generated at startup as a safety net in case a router blocks mDNS multicast (rare on consumer gear).

### Changes
- `scripts/generate-qr` rewritten: generates 3 QR codes now
  - `qr-1-join-wifi.png` — WiFi auto-join
  - `qr-2-singer-rig-local.png` — `http://rig.local:3300/singer` (PERMANENT — print this one)
  - `qr-3-singer-ip-fallback.png` — `http://<current-ip>:3300/singer` (backup)
- Verified mDNS working: `rig` advertised via Bonjour, `rig.local` resolves
- Deployed QRs to GitHub Pages for archiving

### Inseego MiFi Setup
- Admin page: `http://192.168.0.1`
- SSID: `PlaceholderDuo`, WPA2, password: `showtime`
- **Critical**: Disable AP/Client Isolation (found under WiFi → Advanced)
- No SIM card needed — functions as WiFi access point only
- Subnet: 192.168.0.x (gateway 192.168.0.1)

### Venue Checklist
1. Power on Inseego/AirPort
2. MacBook connects (Ethernet preferred)
3. `start show server` — generates fresh QRs, starts both servers
4. Print `qr-1-join-wifi.png` and `qr-2-singer-rig-local.png`
5. Place on tables/stage

### Print-Ready QR Files
`~/Documents/projects/live-band-karaoke/`
- `qr-1-join-wifi.png` — "Join WiFi" sign
- `qr-2-singer-rig-local.png` — "Request a Song" sign (permanent URL)

---

## Session 5: Final Prep — Print Signage, Dell Teleprompter, Inseego Config — 2026-07-11

`#music #iphoneliveserver #showtime`

## 2026-07-11 — Pre-Show: Server Integration + TUI Enhancements

### Session: LSM Server Merger + WiFi Key + Band Server Validation

#### Done
- **Merged LSM server (:3000)** into `start show server` flow — iPhone controller now lives here
- **Validated band server (:3300)** — 328 songs loaded, working:
  - Band view (`/band`) — queue, song info, link to teleprompter
  - Teleprompter (`/teleprompter`) — full-screen chord-colored lyrics
  - Singer queue (`/singer`) — public, no auth needed
- **Added WiFi credentials to config** (`wifi_ssid`, `wifi_password` in `config.json`)
- **TUI `w` key** — Press `w` → overlay shows WiFi SSID + password + band login
  - Works in both queue and now-playing focus modes
  - Any key dismisses
- **Updated TUI URL display** — Shows iPhone controller on port 3000
- **Password remains:** `showtime` (band auth)

#### Current State
- LSM server (:3000): running via launchd, auto-restarts
- Main server (:3300): launched by `start show server`, 328 songs
- Stage HUD (:5800): launched by `start show server`, 20 bumper tracks
- Dell (rdfx5): auto-connects on boot, status TUI → Firefox kiosk
- TUI: manages singer queue, WiFi info via `w` key

#### One Command
`start show server` — starts everything. Ctrl-C stops it all.
